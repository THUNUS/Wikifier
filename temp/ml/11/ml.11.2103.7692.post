So I just went through <ref name="video" type="sai">the lecture video</ref> that explains how we get a vector to project data on so that the projection error is minimized.

The primary goal of dimensionality reduction and thus of PCA is to compress data from n dimensions to k dimensions where k<=n.

Why then do we care at all about projection error ? All we need is some projection of the data at hand in order to reduce it's dimensions.

What is the minimization of the projection error achieving ?
