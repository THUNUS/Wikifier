hi, first of all i must say i am enjoying the course thoroughly. So now my question is about content explain in above said video i.e. as professor told we can merge two features into one by citing his example of using area as a feature by multiplying both the feature(frontage*depth) instead of using them individually which will reduce the no. of features and ultimately our calculation time but i want to say that here in Indian state people pay different amount of money to buy the houses which had same area but have different size of front and depth for example the house had more frontage will get high selling value then  the house having less frontage size although both of them having same area. So my point is if such scenario occur , in which two house could have different selling price while having same area but difference in their frontage size, then our approach of reducing the feature no. will have sheer adverse effect on accuracy of our result.
Thank you.
