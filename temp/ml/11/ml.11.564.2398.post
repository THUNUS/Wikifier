You won't hit a saddle point in linear regression. But this is an interesting general question. The gradient is 0 at a saddle point, or indeed at a local maximum. If you landed precisely on one of these points you'd never leave it. It's highly unlikely in practice of course. And in practice you can test the gradient at some epsilon around the point to detect the case if it mattered.
