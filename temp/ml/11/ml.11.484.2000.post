Is it possible to watch some lectures in advance? Or at least watch old lectures from previous version of this course?
I know there are official Stanford lectures on YouTube or iTunes U but for me the video quality is too bad... Specifically I cannot see formulas on the blackboard well, so it is sometimes hard to read them.
I'm quite in a hurry to acquire some knowledge about neural networks for my theses. I could read about it somewhere but Andrew's lectures are just more complete.
Are there videos of previous version of this course somewhere on the web?

thank you
