Sir, 
u r doing an excellent job.
But please make lectures little fast.things r repeated lot of time. If we dont understand any part we can pause it or replay it, But if we get bored we cant fast forward it ,so please make them short.
And if possible also make programming assignments more interesting, as we only do matrix transposes and multiplications.and sometimes just blindly follow instructions given in program comment lines..
