In <ref name="video" type="mai">the videos</ref> sometimes the abbreviation "s.t." is used (for example in SVM - mathematics behind large margin classification, <ref name="slide" type="sai">second slide</ref>: SVM decision boundary).

I didn't find it in my English-German dictionary, an translation tool and the English Wikipedia.
