We want to use our performance on the test set as an estimate of the algorithm's performance on any unseen data that we will encounter.  This means that it would be cheating to use the test set to determine any parameters because we have "peeked" at the supposedly-unseen test examples.  If we did this, our performance on the test set will over-estimate the accuracy on other unseen data.
