Can somebody please explain to me clearly what a partial derivative is? In the video lectures we talk a lot of calculating partial derivatives but I keep forgetting what they are. So, I need someone to explain it to me fully. 

My guess: in linear regression we used a formula to calculate the tangent of the curve to minimize THETA. Is that formula a partial derivative???
