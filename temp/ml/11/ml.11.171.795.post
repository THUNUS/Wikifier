Hi.

In the definition of the hypothesis the indices of the sumation begins at $$j=\theta$$, but it should be $$j=0$$.

Another error: The octave-code for the unvectorized implementation says:

$$  thetat(j) * x(y)$$

It should be:

$$ theta(j) * x(j) $$

The video lecture is fine. It has not those errors
