The recommendation in lecture was to scale data between [-3,3], but how should I handle highly skewed data or data with outliers? 

For example, US income is highly skewed, so a linear scaling would put all the data at -3 and only the upper tail would span the range between [-3,3]. Another example would include an outlier that is 10X larger than all other values in the data. Again, a linear scale would put all data at -3 except for one value at +3.
