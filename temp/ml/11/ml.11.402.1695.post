in week2, comparaison are made to use either normal equation rather than gradient descent depending if you have only few features or ten of thousands, to million of features.
i wondered what kind of problems could require up to a million of features?

i can think about text related problems where each word or n-gram is a feature but i'm not sure what kind of problems could fit that setting.

anyone has examples?
