$$J_{cv}(\theta)$$ is expected to be lower because we use it in a bunch of ways to better train our model, so the parameters are also trained in part to fit the cross-validation set. For example, we use cross-validation set to chose lambda parameter. Since that lambda choice is based on cross-validation set, $$J_{cv}(\theta)$$ is expected to be lower than if we haven't done so. But we don't base any part of the training on the test set, so $$J_{test}(\theta)$$ will probably be larger.
