Not sure if anyone is coming back to this course as it ended a while ago, however, I did not have a time to go through it until last week..
I would say a good way to handle the reviews would be to add another algorithm, to weigh the reviews according to their age. So older reviews would weigh less then newer. 
Another problem that for example Netflix might deal with is that the reviews are coming from multiple users (whole family is sharing one account) so they might be highly inconsistent. A solution would be to add multiple profiles per account, maybe with an automatic recognition of the user within a single account.
