I don't really understand how x_1+x_2 = 3 means a coordinate set with a line that passes through 3 on both the x and y axis (x and y being x_1 and x_2 respectively).

I mean... in this equation x_1+x_2=3, both of these x could be any number that together adds up to three. How does this translate to the example chart in the video and the coordinates?
