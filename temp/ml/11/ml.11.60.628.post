I was wondering the same thing because of the multiple "grade and descent" and "cos/cause function". There is a link on the main page to [Help with Subtitles][1]. However, I don't know if the corrections are used to update the official subtitles. And I have not found a way to do some batch fixes (ie. replace all instances of the same mistake in a video) which makes fixing the subtitles pretty tedious.
