In this video, I did not understand the purpose of the training set when we divide the data into three parts.  What I understood was that we train the hypotheses on the validation set, choose the hypothesis, and then go to the test set.  I did not catch where the training set came in.  Do you train a second time after picking the hypothesis on the training set and before going to the test?
