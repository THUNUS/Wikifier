 Well, I do agree with you that Î¸ values should be put along the x-axis, s0 there seems to be a small notation mistake in the second graph at around 5.00 - 5.30 .

 I suppose this figure depicts the case when J is the function of one variable only. It is the easiest case to draw and at the same time it is completely adequate to explain the
 problem of gradient descent overshooting.
