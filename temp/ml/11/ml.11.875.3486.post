A partial answer to your question is that we don't lose any information when we scale. All the scaling operations are completely reversible. You can recover the original data whenever you want. It's more like deciding to measure temperature in degrees Celsius instead of in degrees Kelvin. 

And the scaling doesn't change the actual optimum. It just makes the numerics behave better. If you do finite-element analysis, you may have seen pre-scaling features that let you assign different units to different dimensions. So if you are simulating the heat flow through a thin film, some programs let you use, say, micrometers for the thickness dimension, but millimeters for the width dimension. That gives you elements with nice numerical properties, without having to have a zillion of them.
