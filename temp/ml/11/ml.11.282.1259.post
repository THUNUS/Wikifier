This problem is related to browsers. For example, FireFox on Mac OS X shows overlapping text, but Safari renders everything correctly. On Windows, FireFox sometimes renders incorrectly, but IE9 seems to render well. See this thread for more reports: https://class.coursera.org/ml/forum/thread?thread_id=141
