I am in grave confusion.

What was told in class regarding multicalss classification was to find the class to which a given vector x belongs for a given parameter Theta (vector) .

But nothing was told as to how to find Theta for a given training set (for a multiclass classification problem.) ! Or was something told earlier that applies to multiclass classification ?

Please tell,

Thank you
