I think I understand this pretty well, but I just want confirmation that others might have the same question.

If the decision boundary is the boundary that separates the regions x of the R2 where h(x)>0 from those where h(x)<0, then it is possible that the regions where h(x)>0 are not connected.  This makes sense mathematically, but I'm curious how you discover such a characteristic in the dataset PRIOR to designing the model structure? In the case where there are 2 features, it's easy enough since you can visually see it in a plot (if x1 is feature 1, x2 is feature two, and you use "X" or "O" to denote "success" or "failure" in the plot, such clusters become apparent.)

But how do you discover such a relationship in higher dimensions????
