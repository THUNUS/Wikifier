Hi,

I am still coping up with the lesson due to busy schedule. 

Here's my simple question:
 I have this code from <ref name="video" type="sai">the video</ref>

octave-3.2.4:56> while true,
> v(i)=999;
> i=i+1;
> if 1==6,
> break;
> end;
> end;

yet I forgot to initialize the value of i. I should have i=1. When I run the code, it didnt do anything. How can I go back and edit it so that I can initialize the value of "i"?
