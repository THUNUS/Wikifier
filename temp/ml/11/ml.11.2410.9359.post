In response to Andrew Mason, the notes are done. But, when someone (including me) finds a problem, or I think of something useful to add to an existing section, the notes get updated with small changes since it is so easy to do. The date of last update is shown on the web page. Since these are just informal notes, there is no "change log" or anything like that. Thanks for those positive responses!
