I don't understand how you complete the equation for J (when minimizing).

The problem he gave was when J(0). 
I don't get how if the points are at (1, 1) (2, 2) and (3, 3) how in the equation h theta(x(i)-y(i))2
sorry for not having the right notation but I hope someone can get what i mean. (x(i)-y(i))2 for points (1,1) would be 0 squared right? I don't see how he got 1 squared + 2 squared + 3 squared.

Thanks.
