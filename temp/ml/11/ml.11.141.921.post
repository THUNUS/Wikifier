Same thing here, FF 11.0 and 12.0 on Windows 7

Edit: I have the problem on both my screens: 1600x900 and 1280x1024

And just to narrow down on things; I only have a problem where equations are involved. These are rendered over the normal text, which makes them unreadable.  Almost all the questions have equations though and not being able to read them properly makes them hard to answer.
