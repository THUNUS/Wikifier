That's a very important point -- quadratic vs. linear penalties for errors.  Generalizing, you an do some really cool things by combining higher powers of the error and using a multi-component cost function.  For example, you can represent constraints as steep-but-everywhere-continuously differentiable-to-all-orders functions which strongly "repel" the solution from "danger zones" when they get close, but otherwise have negligible impact on the main, goal-seeking component of the cost function.  You *could* just apply a huge penalty when the model crosses into a danger zone, but this abrupt discontinuous "kick" may excite oscillations (or even trigger runaway instability) in the solver -- or a physical system!   Consider a so-called bang-bang control system.  Works ok for your thermostat (first-order system) but not so hot for airplanes and rockets.  :)
