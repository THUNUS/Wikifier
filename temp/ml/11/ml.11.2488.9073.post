This must be trivial, but why do we choose the principal eigenvector as solution for the maximisation problem max u^T \Sigma u, subject to u^T u = 1 ?
Using the Lagrange multipliers method, don't we end up with something like \Sigma u - \lambda u = 0, which holds for all eigenvectors, not only for the principal one?
