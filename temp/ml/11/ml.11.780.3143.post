I too think this can be solved by a simple feature scaling. For example you could scale square feet data logarithmically. That way the absolute differences between large areas will be smaller compared to differences between smaller areas.

Or you could turn lambda into a n-length vector of regularization coefficients, turning penalty into $$\displaystyle\sum\limits_{j=0}^n \lambda_{j}\theta_{j}^{2}$$. Notice that you now don't have to exclude $$\theta_{0}$$, just let $$\lambda_{0}$$ be 0. But I'm not completely sure how you could learn the lambda parameters. If anyone has any idea about this, please let me know.
