Prof. Ng,

Thank you so much for your wonderful work on the lectures and exercises for this course.

I have one small request.  When recording video of octave/gnuplot interaction, could you please move your mouse pointer away from the command line?  I keep thinking it's my own mouse, and trying to move it out of the way myself, which of course does no good and distracts me from your great lectures.

Thanks,
Brian
