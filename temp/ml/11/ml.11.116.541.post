Hello,

I am enrolled in a Machine Learning course at the University of Amsterdam. I was previously using ml-class.org as my teacher said it was useful. Now however the video's about Unsupervised learning (which I am in need of right now) as well as the entire site refer to this site.

I was wondering if I could get the video's about K-means. I need them because I need to program an unsupervised clustering learning algorithm. I will need to do adjustments here and there and those video's give a sense of a framework on which I could build.

Would you be so kind as to send me the video's in advance?

Greetings, Robert.
