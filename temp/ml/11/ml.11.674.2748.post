Dear Sir/TAs,

I realised we have a minor Notational Typo in "<ref name = "video" type = "sci">Video 6 - 5 - Simplified Cost Function and Gradient Descent</ref>" @ 9:00 min.; or <ref name = "slide" type = "sci">slide No. 21 of "docs_slides_Lecture6.pdf"</ref>

The index used for parameters 'theta' was 'j' consistently throughout all lectures, except at the point above, where 'i' was mistakenly used. 
We have been using 'i' to index the training examples. 

Thanks & Regards
