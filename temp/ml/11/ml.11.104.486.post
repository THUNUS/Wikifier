Look at the question "You want to predict how many of these items will sell over the next 3 months.". It asks you the number of  items shall be sold, not if an item shall be sold or not. Seems you basically misinterpreted the question.
Obviously to predict future sales, you've got to know something about past sales, so the problem assumes knowledge about past sales (otherwise it would be pure guesswork)

Hope it helps :-)
