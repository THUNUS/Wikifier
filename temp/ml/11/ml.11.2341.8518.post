I tried speeding up and slowing down the videos using the + and - key, but it doesn't seem to work on Windows XP or 7 on IE and Firefox. Has anyone else faced this problem? All other keyboard shortcuts seem to work fine. I really need to be able to speed up the videos, since I have very little time for the courses and I can't afford to sit through it at the speed it goes. The previous ML course had the speeding up feature right on the video, which I loved, but now I am stuck.

I did try downloading the video and playing it fast, but then that comes with its own problems (bad segments in the video, no quiz questions, etc.). Any help would be highly appreciated.
