Oh, I think I know what confused you. If you look carefully at that plot you'll see that one of the axes is labeled 'x' and the other one is labeled 'y'. So given the dataset (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), the first coordinate refers to 'x' (feature) and the second coordinate refers to 'y' (target variable). Then Andrew defines matrix X = [1 1; 1 2; 1 3] and vector y = [1; 2; 3]. The first column of the matrix 'X' is all ones ([1; 1; 1], as I pointed earlier), the second column is the value of the feature for each training example ([1; 2; 3], the first coordinate in the dataset), and vector 'y' is the value of the target variable for each training example ([1; 2; 3], the second coordinate in the dataset).
