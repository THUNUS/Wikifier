<ref name="lecture" type="sci">In lecture 9-2</ref>, Dr. Ng showed the delta (error) function of each layer.

Assume there are four layers in total, I can understand the delta function of output layer is
$$\delta_j^{(4)} = a_j^{(4)} - y_j$$

Dr. Ng showed that 
$$\delta^{(i)} = (\Theta^{(i)})^T \delta^{i+1} .* g'(z^{(i)})$$
for i = 2 and 3 (about 5:40 in the video)

How are these delta functions of hidden layers derived?
Thanks!
