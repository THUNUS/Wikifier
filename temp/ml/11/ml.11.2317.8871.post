I agree this question (apart from the transpose typo) is somewhat tricky. My problem is that I am used to using index notation and the Einstein summation convention, which says it all, so thinking in terms of a column matrix of rows and a row matrix of columns means I have to think.
There are a lot of cases where free indices are not tied up properly throughout the course. I'm not necessarily saying it's a bad thing if you are confident with the notation, but I think for beginners I would prefer to always put in all indices and introduce the summation convention at the start. But then I am from a mathematical background where obsessively putting in everything is desirable (unless you are competing with other groups who might then publish first).

The first time round I took it as being an outer product, which it is actually what it is when you look at it as a column matrix of rows and a row matrix of columns.
The second time round, after looking at it for ten minutes I finally saw it again, it's like one of those pictures with two meanings. I think what is making it difficult is that I am used to using index notation and not having to read in the missing indices. Each of the terms in the final product matrix is in fact a row-column product, and that is not so easy to deduce at first sight. 
It would be nice to know if anyone else had problems and what they thought. I'd just put in the missing transpose letters unless altering the style of the whole course.
