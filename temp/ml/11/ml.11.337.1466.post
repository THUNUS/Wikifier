Hi Farhad Omar,

May be you are missing a very important thing. That is, in linear regression, there will be no local optima, always a global one. The instructor said that a lot of time. At least I did not find any case where I need to worry about local optima in these 2 weeks lecture. If local optima situation comes in future, hopefully they will be addressed.

Hope that helps. :)
