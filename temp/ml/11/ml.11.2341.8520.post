I have been very successful downloading the videos and playing them in the freeware VLC player (videolan, version 2.0.1 "Twoflower") within Windows XP.  The [ and ] keys control the speed while the scroll wheel does volume. When I am familiar with some topic, I play at about 1.6x speed (or faster) just to make sure I am not missing anything. I have had no quality problems with the videos in the VLC player.
