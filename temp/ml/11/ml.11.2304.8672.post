As others have pointed out, it's easy to tell where the decision boundary should be, and as a result, it's easy to tell what direction theta should have. Now, the key part is to note that there are two conditions that must be met (one of which is $$||\theta||   p^{(i)} \geq 1$$)... what is the minimum value of $$||\theta||$$ that satisfies these conditions for all training examples?
