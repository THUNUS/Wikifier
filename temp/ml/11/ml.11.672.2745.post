I attended a lecture by Tomaso Poggio a few years back where he talked about unsupervised classification of objects in images. When shown a bunch of images with cars in them, the algorithm was able to come up with a set of features that did a good job of identifying cars in test images. You might consider this a clustering algorithm but the ultimate application was classification.
