What I think the answer to your question is,"In the first example you given,the event of interest is to find out TOTAL number of the items which will sell over next 3 months ,we are not interested in the particular indivisual item,if it was the case that we are interested in each item to bee sold or not then it will be a case of classification ,but luckily we are interested in total number of items so we have to focus on total number not indivisual and hence iits the regression problem."
And in your second problem it seems quite obvious that u are interested in each account and there are only two decisions which learning algo needs to answer either hacked or not ,yes or no,either 0 or 1.
