Not all projections are created equal. For example, you could project from n to k dimensions by just ignoring any n-k of the n dimensions. But you can feel intuitively that something's wrong with completely ignoring some dimensions and completely retaining others, right? Why favor some dimensions more? So if there are 'bad' projections, what makes them so?

Here the projection error is a measure of the distortion, or information lost, by projecting. The farther a point has to project, the more is being lost somehow and the projection is less true to the original data. In the formalization of this idea, the intuition is that you are distorting distances more if the projection error is large. Things that were far apart are now near and can't be distinguished from things that were near.
