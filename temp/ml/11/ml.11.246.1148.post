try to open the website in different bowser like Google chrome or Firefox. The player it uses is HTML5 player. It might not be available in your current browser. See if you browser is up-to-date. If still problem persists, then go to preferences and change the palyer preference from HTML5 to Adobe Flash Player. I hope it helps.
