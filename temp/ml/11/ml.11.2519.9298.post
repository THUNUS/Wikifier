On <ref name="slide" type="sci">slide 23 of lecture 14</ref>, he calls this "total variation in the data".  (It looks more like *average variation* to me.)  This is used as a normalizing factor applied to the "average square projection error".  The result is a metric that tells him how closely his approximated data, constructed from a lower dimension projection, is to the original (full dimension) data.
