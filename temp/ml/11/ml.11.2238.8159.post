<ref name="video" type="sai">at 16:35</ref> the constrint should be 

p^(1) ||Theta|| >= 1

which at the moment is key to understanding where the margin originates from.

Actually

p^(1) ||Theta|| >= 0

is not that bad to writeout, because comparing the effects of the two constraints clarifies this.
