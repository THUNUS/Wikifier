There is a very good mathematical reason for applying the log function. If a phenomenon outputs only positive real numbers, then chances are it is some type of log distribution. Although the process behind making the data may be normal (this is a reasonable assumption, because of something called the central limit theorem), the medium of the positive reals causes the distribution to be log-normal. I'll try to show you how this is different from a normal distribution with an example: Suppose that you have a distribution which is restricted to the positive reals (such as the amount of calcium in a glass of orange juice). Let us say (ignoring units) that the mean of this distribution is 1. Outliers in which an excessive amount of calcium is measured could be many times the mean. (So an outlier might be a glass that contains 5 units of calcium). However, an outlier in the other direction cannot fall below 0. We might consider 0.2 units of calcium an outlier. On the contrary, 1.8 units may be much more common. Distributions like this tend to be log-normal. You can turn them into a normal distribution by applying a logarithm, and that is exactly what Professor Ng did.
