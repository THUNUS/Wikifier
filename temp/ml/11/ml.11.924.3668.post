I was viewing '4 - 2 - Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables (5 min).mp4' in VLC and it abruptly hanged in between. I tried a few more times, then checked the streaming video, and found it had an interactive part. Is there a way to identify which videos have interactive questions during playback, or is there any player that plays those downloaded video(with embedded interactive)?? 

Thanks!
