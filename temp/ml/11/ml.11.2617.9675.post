Hi all,

To produce the projection of vectors in X onto the eigenvectors given by the svd() function, we simply do

Z = X * U(:, 1:K);

More specifically, to project a vector u (size n x 1) onto another vector v (n x 1), we simply do

projected_vector = u' * v;

My question is: what is the mathematical theory behind the above method?

Thanks!
