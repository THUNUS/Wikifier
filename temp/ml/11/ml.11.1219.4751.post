In <ref name="video" type="sci">the first video of logistic regression</ref> Prof. Ng says because the Y's of training data are either 0 or 1 then h_theta(x) should be in the range of[0..1]. But I don't understand why. If h_theta(x) for a new sample (in prediction time) is not exactly 1 nor 0 then why forcing it to be in [0..1] is beneficial? We can put a threshold T on h_theta(x) and say if you are greater than T you are 1 and vice versa and simply forget about whether it is really 0 or 1 or between these numbers.
