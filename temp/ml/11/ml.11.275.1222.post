Good time of day.

As I think, there is a mistake at the end of the video, that I mentioned at the title of this thread.
Andrew says that matrice:
$$(X^T X)^{-1}$$ 
has a size of [n*n], but X has size [m*(n+1)], so
matrice $$(X^T X)^{-1}$$ would have a size [(n+1)*(n+1)]

Please, correct me, if it is wrong. :-))

P.S. Maybe mistake is not so important for this course, but from the math view it is that one.
