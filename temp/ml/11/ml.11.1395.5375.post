You get quadratic and cubic features by combining your individual features and treat them as new features of the problem.  If you have a problem with three features: $$x_1, x_2, x_3$$ you get a quadratic feature by multiplying any two of these features (including a feature and itself) together to create a new feature.  So you could use $$x_4 = x_1^2$$, $$x_5=x_1 x_2$$, $$x_6=x_1 x_3$$ and so on.  Cubic features are combinations of three features, so $$x_1^3$$, $$x_1^2 x_2$$, $$x_1 x_2 x_3$$ etc.

To calculate the number of quadratic features, he was using the fact that if you have *N* individual features, you can get approximately $$N^2/2$$ new quadratic features, which comes from doing a little counting.  First, recognize that with N features, you can multiply $$x_1$$ by any of your N features to get a new one.  Then, because $$x_1 x_2=x_2 x_1$$, you can multiply $$x_2$$ by any of $$N-1$$ features to get a new quadratic feature. Keep doing this counting and you see that there are $$N + (N-1) + (N-2) + ... + 2 + 1 = \sum\limits_{n=1}^N n = (N^2 - N) / 2$$, which is approximately $$N^2/2$$ for very large N.
