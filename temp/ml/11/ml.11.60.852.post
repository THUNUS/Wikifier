That's because Coursera doesn't make any subtitles, neither the universities. 

All the subtitles are made by students, for students via. Amara. It's like an online service where you can help make subtitles for videos on the net.
All the work is voluntarily, so unless you speak english or there are some nice people out there, who speak your language as well and wanna make subtitles for the videos, then you're gonna have trouble following the course. 

I'd like to help make some subtitles into spanish, but my spanish isn't good enough.

The reason that the subtitles for the videos are a bit mixed is because people from time to time becomes lazy. It takes a lot of work to make subtitles (I personally got bored after translating just 2 videos into danish for another course)
