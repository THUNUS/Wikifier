[This](http://www.sccg.sk/~haladova/principal_components.pdf) text goes a little deeper into the theory of PCA. I found its treatment of eigenvectors somewhat superficial, but you should be able to supply online in that regard. [Khan Academy](www.khanacademy.org) covers them in its linear algebra section, for example.

Good luck! :)
