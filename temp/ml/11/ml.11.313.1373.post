At about 7:50 into the week 2 video, "Control Statements: for, while, if statements" the professor states that octave functions can return multiple values. As I read the code shown, the sample function is just returning a single array variable, containing multiple values. Well within the capabilities of nearly(?) any language I have ever used. Am I missing something, or is he being a little over overenthusiastic? granted, octave arrays are very easy to use.
