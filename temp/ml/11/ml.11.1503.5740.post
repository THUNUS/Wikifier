Hi, I am not very clear the reason why we will need **cross validation set**. Isn't it the same idea as **test set**? Could you please elaborate more of it?

Also here are some more question about cross validation setï¼Œ

 - If **cross validation set error** is high but the **test set error** is low, what should I do? 
 - If **cross validation set error** is low but the **test set error** is high, what should I do?

Thanks!
