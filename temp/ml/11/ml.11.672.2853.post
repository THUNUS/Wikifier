Hi, Abhishek.  I would think the results of clustering could depend a lot on the type of distance metric you use as well.  You might end up with different types of features detected in relation to that choice.  In the case of images and object detection, you could turn up whole objects with a simple metric, but you could also easily get different regions of an object, according to the metric used.  I supposed that some metrics could be more suitable for a problem domain than others.
