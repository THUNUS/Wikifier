Hi!

In other courses from coursera there are some review lectures every one-two weeks where lecturer discusses common questions and whatever else. Also in crypto course there would be final week with advanced topics that students would choose. 

So :) to my mind it would be great if we had a lecture on Maximum-likelihood estimation applied for our cost function in Logistic Regression section.
