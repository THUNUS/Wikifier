In <ref name="video" type="sci">Video 16.2</ref>, Prof. Ng shows how to compute theta for each user separately. He then shows how to compute thetas for all the users jointly (using a double summation). 


What is the purpose of the joint optimization? The estimates of each of theta for each user appear to be independent of each other. The do not appear to interact.
