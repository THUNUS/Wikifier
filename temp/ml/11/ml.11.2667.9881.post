In week 10's Photo OCR video about getting lots of data (at last slide), Amazon's Mechanical Turk is mentioned. Is anyone aware of any current ML tasks on Mechanical Turk? Are there other crowd sourcing sites (the video said that Amazon's is the most popular, that measns there are others) with ML tasks?
