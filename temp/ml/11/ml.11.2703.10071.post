The concept of sliding windows is interesting, but considering it might requires 500 000 calls of a classifier to simply analyse a single image, how could it be used for e.g. detecting eyes/nose/mouth of a *video* in real time, sounds not practical no?

are other methods than sliding windows for live video analysis (video surveillance with detection of anormal behaviors of whatever other applications requiring real time image vision). 

anyone with thought and/or experience on that?

thanks
