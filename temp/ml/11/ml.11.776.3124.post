The closed captions on the videos in English are not perfect.  One example: at just after one minute into <ref name = "video" type="sci">video 7.1 (the problem of overfitting)</ref>, the audio is "the size of the house increases" but the captions give "the size of the housing freezes".   Ironically this is because the machines have not learned enough yet...

Is there any way to report such mistakes and perhaps have corrections incorporated into the transcripts? I'm a native speaker of English and can hear well (I just turn on the captions for fun sometimes) but I think it would be valuable for those whose English or hearing isn't as good.
