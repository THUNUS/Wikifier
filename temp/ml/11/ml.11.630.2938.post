Agreed, same reasons :). Also, I think that right now there are lectures one week in advance but I propose that videos are published at least 2 weeks in advance - that would make the course much more flexible. For example for those who might take 2 weeks vacation (quite common outside US :) ) or for students who tend to travel once quarter is over. In the same time it would not fragment discussion too much.

Unpublished video lectures are available here: http://www.universalsubtitles.org/en/teams/coursera/p/ml though it is sometimes uneasy to figure out right ordering ;)
