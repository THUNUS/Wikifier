Hello, 

I was signed up to the old class and wanted to review some of the lectures but now when I log in to the class it takes me to the new class and I can't see all the lectures :( is there somewhere I can download them from? I had not downloaded all of them before although I know I had the option

I am actually doing a 'real life' class and I need to do an assignment this week, and andrew explained the concepts much better than my real class!

It's quiet frustrating that its not possible to go at your own pace on these courses as not everyone can do this. Please give an option so that you can learn at your own pace.
