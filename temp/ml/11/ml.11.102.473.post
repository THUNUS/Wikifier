I was listening to <ref name="video" type="sco">the [Model Representation][1] video</ref> where Prof Ng used the term "hypothesis" as the mapping function from x to y and said that the reason was just history.  
From what I remember from my PG classes in statistics, this is because all sort of regression testing is essentially a null hypothesis testing.  You set up the hypothesis that Y and unrelated to X and the reject it by calculating the correlation between X and Y.  The same applies to even more complex learning methods, where there is an implicit null hypothesis being tested.  In practice you just do the regression and draw inference
I think this is the reason why there is a "hypothesis" term involved.
