I am having trouble with streaming videos. The center of the screen is filled with lines and I can not see what the instructor is writing. Sometimes it goes away a couple seconds later. I am on a windows 7 machine and using internet explorer. Could be a Coursera thing, since I had the same problems with the PGM videos. 

Did anybody have similar issues?
