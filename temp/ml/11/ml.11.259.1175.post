It is my impression that selecting the learning rate is a reactive process.  As explained in the video, if your cost function is decreasing too slowly, you increase $$\alpha$$, but if your cost function is not converging you would decrease $$\alpha$$.  Finding the optimum learning rate would require knowing where the global minimum is on the cost function.  If you know that, then you don't need the algorithm in the first place.
