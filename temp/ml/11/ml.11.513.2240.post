I was also left wondering why the curve would go back down and was about to post the same question.

It's been a long time since I had to use any higher level maths (calculus hasn't saved my life yet) and pointing out that the curve would eventually decrease **if $$\theta_2$$ is negative** would have left me a little less confused. 

Yes, it could be inferred from the shape of the graph that $$\theta_2$$ must be negative, but no, my brain didn't think that was a fact worthy of recall :( I presume that $$\theta_3$$ in $$\theta_3 x^3$$ _must_ be positive if $$\theta_2$$ is negative.

Having said that, I'm now wondering if the curve would fit well since at some point $$\theta_3 x^3$$ is going to make the price skyrocket...
