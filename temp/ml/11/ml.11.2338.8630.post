yes, the weights get updated during the back prop. However, they don't get passed back to the previous layer as there is no 'input' to the bias units. Also, with the maths, there was an error in <ref name="lecture" type="sai">the lecture</ref> that has been fixed in <ref name="exercise" type="sai">the programming exercise description</ref> (one of the superscripts in the back propagation said l+1 instead of l)
