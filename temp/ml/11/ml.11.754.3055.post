There is no reason to expect circular contours regardless of scale. If one feature has a stronger influence than another influence, contours will be elliptical. For example, size of house and size of land will both affect the price of the house. They are both measured in the same units (square metres or similar). Rescaled they would both be in similar ranges. However, it is likely that size of the house has more effect on the final price than size of the land.
