I am running into the same problem. I was halfway through the course last week, and now it has all been reset and I have been asked to sign up again. After signing up, I am not able to see material more than two weeks worth. 

Unfortunately, i cannot torrent it. Is there an official way to get to all the video lectures that were available until last week? 

Thanks.
