I dont think you should complain about the pace of the course.You maybe a very fast learner.You can create your own challenges as said by Athenkosi Mase.
I think the pace of the course is perfect.Like you and a few others mentioned,watch the videos at x2.0 or whatever.And maybe you have a decent background in AI.That may not be the case with everybody.This is not a advanced course in ML.I guess his open classroom course will be right for someone like you.Again,for beginners,this is definitely the perfect pace for concepts to sink in.
