Haha, you get my upvote. Without you I wouldn't have realised that there are embedded quizzes. In the first videos they were part of it and after that I just thought he lost it, because he had no idea what to ask.
Coming back to the question, I don't think that it has something to do with the embedded quiz, simply because there is no interaction like this in MP4, or at least I have never heard of it. I tried the downloaded file with VLC 2.0.0 and it works perfectly at least in this case. Since I have many other crashes with VLC though (Win7 64bit) I went back using mplayer.

I think it would be better if the embedded questions in the downloaded video are two successive images, one with the question and one with the answer, both displayed for a few seconds. If the user decides to answer them he just pauses the video.
Another possibilty would be to have these quizzes added in the "review questions" section.
