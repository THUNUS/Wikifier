Prof. Ng sometimes states an equation without deriving it. He does this for good reason since some of the derivations are rather involved.. I have tried to provide some of these derivations in "Ng machine learning notes" PDF at http://rimrockinteractive.net/plucht/. A rudimentary knowledge of calculus and matrices is assumed on the part of the reader. Other necessary "math topics" are developed as needed, and everything is done in the notation used by Prof. Ng in his lectures. The document has been getting updated as the course proceeds.
