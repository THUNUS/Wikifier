The thetas are weights not locations in parameter space. If you have something with regular variation, you are actually introducing a bias so that, for example, you would be asserting that node 10 has 10 times the importance of node 1. Using random initialisation starts all the weights about equal and is actually tailored as unbiased. The regular variation is more suitable for something like genetic algorithms where you are trying to explore the fitness landscape over the whole parameter space.
