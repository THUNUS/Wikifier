In the lecture about using dimensionality reduction for visualization, prof Ng. uses an example of N features for each country and reduce them to 2.
Then he says that the two remaining variables can be interpreted as z1 = country size /GDP and z2 = per person GDP.

how could one came with such an interpretation?  it is simply an intuition no? 
how to interpret the meaning of remaining variables in general when using Dimensionality reduction for visualization?
