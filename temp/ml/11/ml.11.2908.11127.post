     When I am watching the video lectures after I answer the questions the screen remains frozen on the question and only the audio continues.  The only way I have found around this is to exit and restart the video and move the shuttle slider past the question.  
     Is there a library, patch or upgrade that I am missing or anyway of curing this problem?
