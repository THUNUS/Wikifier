The norm of the difference shown in <ref name="slide" type="sai">the test slide</ref> is not squared. It seems a fairly trivial difference, but the resulting curve is much more triangular with a sharp point unless the square is there.
Also <ref name="slide" type="sai">one of the typed slides</ref> about half way through says "If x if far from l" and I think it means 'If x is far from l'
