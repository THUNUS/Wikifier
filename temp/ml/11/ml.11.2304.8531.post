You understand intuitively where the best dividing line is, right? Go back and note what $$\Theta$$ is as a result. At first it seems like $$\Theta$$ isn't exactly determined -- pretty clear what direction the vector is in but how big? Because of regularization we want $$||\Theta||$$ to be small (the minimization constraint in the question). Because of how the SVM is defined to maximize margin we need it to be big too to make the projections large enough. So those two forces do end up exactly determining how big $$\Theta$$ must be, which is what the question is asking.
