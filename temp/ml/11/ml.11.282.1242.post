It's a very annoying thing: formulas and text are overlapping during the in-video questions. This is also happening on other coursera videos. Sometimes this makes very hard to answer the questions.

Is it possible to do something about it, maybe just put on a todo list?

(Btw: Thanks for the learning opportunity! It's very generous of you!)
