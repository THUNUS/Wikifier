It seemed interesting to me SVM gradient was not covered in <ref name="lecture" type="sci">week 7 lecture</ref>. Are we supposed to try to come up with it ourselves? At the moment it seems non-trivial to me because SVM cost function is discontinuous and I'm not quite sure how to take the derivative of that...
