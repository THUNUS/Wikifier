Recommender systems lectures provide an idea of how to use algorithm to learn features and $$theta$$ parameters for some pre-existing data. But I didn't get any answer on following question: what should recommender system do when users change their raitings or if new users arrive to system with their set of movie ranks. Should leanring algorithm be run from scratch in that case to get new set of features/$$theta$$ parameters ?
