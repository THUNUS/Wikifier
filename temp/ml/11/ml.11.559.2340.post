I have found Professor Ng's videos to be quite excellent and I can think of many cases where I might want to review one or more of the lectures in the future. What happens to our access to the videos after the class ends? I notice there is no way to download the videos (didn't expect there would be since this can be viewed as intellectual property). I guess what I'm saying is that these lectures are a tremendous resource that I don't necessarily want to lose.
