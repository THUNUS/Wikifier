It seems to me that it's not "symmetry", per se, but rather identicality that needs to be broken.

So long as the input seeds are different, the neural network should work, I'm thinking, (although it may find different local minima).

For a flat problem space, I think we rather want our input seeds to be symmetric in the sense of having a sum total bias of zero.

No?
