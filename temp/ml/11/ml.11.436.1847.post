For review purposes, it would often be useful for the student to go back to a particular video and re-take the popup quizzes for that video at some point in the future, perhaps before tackling the graded review questions.

However, with my RoadRunner access to the Internet, it is almost impossible to open a video and position it to a quiz, even though the locations of the quizzes shows on the timeline at the bottom of the video. All I get is a twirling arrow for a long period of time. Sometimes it finds the quiz and sometimes not.

Therefore, it would be very useful if you could publish those quizzes along with the answers at the end of the pdf file that contains the slides, perhaps showing each of the quizzes in sequence followed by each of the corresponding answers in sequence. That way, the quiz and the answer wouldn't be visible at the same time.
