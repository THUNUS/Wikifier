Thanks for your interesting answer Soren. 
about your example 1. , i see what you mean, but even by creating (meaningful) combination of multiple features, i hardly see how we could go beyond few hundreds or thousands of features (i was wondering about cases in the order of million feature).
for example 2., even if if modeling time series doesn't usually work this way as you said, it does somehow satisfy my curiosity :)

thks!
