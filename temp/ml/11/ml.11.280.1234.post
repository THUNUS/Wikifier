Is it possible to provide lecture notes in PPT's of weekly lectures. I mean that whatever Instructor is teaching in specific slide have that text below specific slide in notes section. It's approach used by Jeffery Ullman in Automata class of coursera .. Please make us those notes available for Future Reference in these class.


Thanks.
