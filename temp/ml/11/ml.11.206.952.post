Just getting started here ...

Dear Professor Ng,

Your otherwise superb early lectures make jarring reference to things you label as "infinite", when really you mean "unbounded".

For example, real data and real computing resources can be unbounded (but never infinite).  In contrast, the set of all positive integers is infinite in size.

You know this, obviously, so I don't understand your use of the word.

Thank you for being such a great teacher.
