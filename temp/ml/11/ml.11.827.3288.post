Hi,
If I look at a video and finish it and delete it there occurs a green mark, that I have 'done' it ;-)

BUT; there is the possibility to go to the next video without closing the video (the x at upper right corner) and this way
of looking to the videos does not show the green mark (of the continued video), which I like would like to see .

Greetings
         Peter
