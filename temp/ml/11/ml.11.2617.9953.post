I'm not sure exactly what you're asking.

If it's why we multiply. Prof. Ng. gave some intuition as to what u' * v means in one of the earlier lectures. It's [the dot product][1], and it measures the length of the projection (the size of the shadow cast, if you will) of u onto v if you were to plot them on the real plane (and v has length 1, as is the case with PCA).

If it's the wider concepts of eigenvectors, orthonormal bases, singular value decomposition and all that jazz, the mathematical theory is linear algebra :)
