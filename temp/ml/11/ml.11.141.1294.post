Probably a stupid question... Could you explain where these "video questions" are supposed to appear? I know they have been mentioned in the videos a couple of times, but when I never saw any, I just assumed that they were referring to the videos being used in some other context where they had annotations. Maybe they had been used in a YouTube-based course.

I must be doing something wrong, clearly. You guys seem to be watching videos in your browsers, while I download them and watch them on my player, namely VLC. Am I missing out?

**Edit**: Nevermind, it *was* a stupid question. It never occurred to me to click on the video title to watch the video. That indeed renders it in a modal dialog and plays right there in the browser. I always went straight for the download, because I would download all available videos and then watch them offline in my own time.
