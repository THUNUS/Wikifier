In the Video/Slide, the error term is computed like this:$$  \delta_{i}^{n_{l}}= a_{i}^{n_{l}}-y_{i}  $$.While in this tutorial (Andrew Ng's another class)http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs294a/sparseAutoencoder_2011new.pdf (Page #8) and in Mitchell's book *Machine Learning*, the error term is computed like this: $$  \delta_{i}^{n_{l}}= -(y_{i}-a_{i}^{(n_{l})})\cdot {g}'(z_{i}^{(n_{l})})  $$. Can anyone explain the difference? Thanks for advance :)
