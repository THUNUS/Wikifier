Hi Zahedi,

Thanks for the replay. I know that in linear regression we mostly deal with convex functions. My question was more general. There is an example of a function in lecture note titled gradient descent intuition after the learning rate explanations that has two minimums a local and a global. So my question was what to do in that kinda of situations, not necessarily dealing with a linear regression cost function per say.
