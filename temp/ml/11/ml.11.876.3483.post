There is only one group of Week 4 videos. Usually there are two groups of videos per week. Also, at the end of the last Week 4 video Prof Ng says "In the next group of videos we will look at how to implement one-vs-all using neural networks."  This is actually the assignment for Week 4. Are these videos missing? If so, it would be great to have them.
Thanks!
