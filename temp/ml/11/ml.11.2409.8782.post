In the lecture XIII.5 we were told that when the elbow method doesn't suggest a number of clusters in a dataset we should rely on the downstream application for the selection (example in lecture was about T-shirt sizes). I have a question from my own work: I try different number of clusters in the data. Next I test the clusters for association with another variable and I find that basically regardless of the number of clusters I get very strong associations. I tried K=2:6. I probably haven't given enough details about my problem (let me know if I need to explain it more) but what does this result tell me about my data? Thank you!
