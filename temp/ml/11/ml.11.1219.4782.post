$$h_{\theta}$$ is actually a probability function, so it makes sense for it to range between 0 and 1 because having a probability greater than 1 or less than zero doesn't mean anything.  You could renormalize so that $$h_{\theta}'=2 h_{\theta}$$ and then say that you will predict a value of 1 if $$h_{\theta}'\ge1$$, but it makes more sense to normalize  so that it represents a probability and 0.5 is your prediction threshold.  If you're training set takes on two values that aren't 0 and 1, say -3 and 5.5, it is easy enough to simply rescale them so that $$-3\rightarrow0$$ and $$5.5\rightarrow1$$ and $$h_{\theta}<0.5$$ would mean you predict a value of -3 and for $$h_{\theta}\ge0.5$$ you predict a value of 5.5.
