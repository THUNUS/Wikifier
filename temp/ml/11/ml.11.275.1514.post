yes. I think it's important to keep in mind that, when andrew uses n, he is referrring to the # of  features and, when he uses
m, he is referring to sample size. I come from a statistics background where n is always the sample size so  thanks for above because I found that part  a little confusing too ( I really like the way he teaches in general )  and was going to ask the same question.

                                                                                                                      mark
