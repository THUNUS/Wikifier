I'm behind (just starting Multivariate Linear Regression).  I note that in the first couple of lectures in that block, after hitting "Continue" the voice track proceeds but the video remains frozen on the review slide.  I find the visuals extremely helpful so this is a major instructional "deficit".  

Any fixes?
