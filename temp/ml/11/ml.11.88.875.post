agree with topic. the volume of the sound recording is too low, and there is a lot of variation, sometimes it can be heard at a certain volume, then it is very hard to listen to it.. Mr. Andrew, please consider using not a desktop microphone, since whenever you turn yout head your voice is not heard, but instead use a clip on mic, and please record the lectures at a higher volume
tnx
