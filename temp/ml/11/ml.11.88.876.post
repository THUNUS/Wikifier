I've listened to other Coursera class videos, such as algorithms 1 and NLP. They don't have the same problem. Their sound is very clear, and consistently good. Here, the sound is muffled, going in and out of clearness, and volume changes a lot. I think this is an equipment problem. I suggest Professor Ng consult with the lecturers from the other classes to find out what audio equipment they used to record the audio. Thank you!
