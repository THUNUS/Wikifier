<ref name="lecture" type="sci">In the lecture "Matrix Matrix Multiplication"</ref>, 

instead of the answer

    9  4
    15 12

shouldn't the final answer of the example

    1 3    0 1
    2 5  x 3 2

be

    9  7
    15 12

?

I studied linear algebra in a coding theory & cryptography class about a year ago so these optional lecture videos are a good refresher. Thanks Andrew :)
