I've only seen the first few <ref name = "lecture" type = "mci">lectures</ref>, but it definitely sounds like the professor is moving toward and away from the microphone often, causing inconsistent volume levels. In the videos I've seen, it looks like he's wearing the mic on his shirt lapel. I'm guessing that each time he looks down towards the tablet is causing the volume change.

 Also, it sounds like something is hitting the mic every so often, or it's being blown into.

Perhaps positioning the mic differently, or using a mic with a windscreen/cover would help for future lectures.
