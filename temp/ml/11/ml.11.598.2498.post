Here's my question.  If you are concerned with learning, and you are specifically concerned with learning the future (predicting), then tell me what the future is.  Tell me what is the definition of the future.  And if you intend on learning something, there must be something which can thus be taught.  If you can't define it with the specificity that you desire, how can you learn it to such a specificity?  You cannot.  So all this "prediction stuff" is hopeless and to me seems like an arbitrary definition of machine learning.  But give me any stock, and share, any virus prevalence and I can tell you what it is every single day, despite changes in new information from previous information.  Just ask me for a stock, and I'll generate screen captures of my AI learning it, perfectly and implicitly.
