For linear regression, I think that $$\theta_{0}$$ is the bias and $$\theta_{1}$$ is the scale applied to x which results in the line plotted by $$h_{\theta}(x)$$.  I kept waiting for professor Ng to state the thetas in these terms, but I haven't gotten through all the videos yet.  Hopefully that tidbit helps someone or maybe someone can poke a hole in my understanding of the terms.
