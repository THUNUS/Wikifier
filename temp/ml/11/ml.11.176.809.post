Hi everybody,

I am already familiar with fundamentals like gradient descent and linear regression. I wondered if I can just skip a video (and probably quizzes in that video)?
Or is it necessary to attempt (most of) the quizzes in the lectures? I think in AI class, one had to attempt a certain percentage of the quizzes in the videos to get the certificate at the end of the course, that's why I'm asking :)
