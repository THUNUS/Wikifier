On <ref name="file" type="sci">Page 7 ,Lecture9.pdf</ref>, when computing delta(2):

delta(2)=(Theta(2))' * delta(3) .*g'(z(2))

it seems that the dimension of  (Theta(2))' * delta(3) is not equal to that of g'(z(2))

for example ,assume a 3 layer NN,input layer size is 3  ,hidden layer size is 10 , output layer size is 3 

so , 

Theta(2) is a matrix of 3*11, delta(3) is 3*1, (Theta(2))' * delta(3)  is 11*1 

But ,z(2)=Theta(1)*a(1) is a matrix of 10*1

I'm confused about that.
