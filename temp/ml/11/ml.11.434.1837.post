Unfortunately, your question doesn't just pertain to linear algebra, but also some rather advanced statistics/econometrics, and the answer is actually rather complicated. As you observe, the "hypotheses" and "cost functions" are indeed very different because the data itself is different. The response here depends on the objective function you choose. Note that in logistic regression you're estimating discrete valued variables, making a choice of a cost function not obvious. [It's not obvious because instead of predicting real values (e.g., cost of a house), you're predicting probabilities of observing particular values (e.g., in a survey on how awesome peanut butter is, given a choice of (1) it's weird and sticky, (2) I like it all right, and (3) I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER NOM NOM, what is the conditional probability that a respondent will choose (3) over (2) given a vector of observables; note here that the responses are ordered, though logistic regression does not require that.)]  Indeed, in the last 20 or so years, researchers have implemented what are called "semi-parametric" models wherein a cost function is employed, but in these cases there is no closed form solution, or at least not one of which I know. 

Let $$y^{(i)} = 1, \ldots, k$$ be a discrete valued variable for which $$k$$ is "small" (usually no more than 10), $$\vec{x}^{(i)}$$ be a vector of $$k$$ explanatory variables, and $$i = 1,\ldots, m$$.  Logistic regression is usually estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, which, in short, chooses coefficients $$\hat{\theta}$$ to maximize the joint conditional probability of having observed $$y^{(i)}$$ given $$\theta,\vec{x}^{(i)}$$, or, in math notation $$f(y^{(1)}, \ldots, y^{(m)} |X,\vec{\theta}),$$ where $$X:=(x^{(1)},\ldots, x^{(m)})$$ and each $$x^{(i)}$$ is $$k$$ dimensional.  If the objective function is globally concave, then the likelihood function has a unique solution. But only in special cases does the likelihood function have an analytic solution. See Greene *Econometric Analysis* (a graduate econometrics text) for more on this. 

If interested, consider taking econometrics, which explicitly focuses on regression analysis and identification of variables (i.e., causality) instead of simply maximizing prediction power, which seems to be the goal here.
