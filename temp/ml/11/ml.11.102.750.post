My stat theory is a bit rusty and at least 8 years old.  But here is my intuitive understanding of hypothesis testing.  It may not be very rigorous.
You use hypothesis testing when you are going to do experiments or randomly sampling the population. You will set up a null hypothesis, for example - "A coin is loaded" and you try to disprove the hypothesis.  You do this by doing the experiment of tossing the coin, and you will observe the results.  You will also define a confidence level, say 99.5%. After the experiment, if the results show that you can reject the null hypothesis with the decided level of confidence, then you will reject it and accept that the coin is loaded.  If you cannot, then you say that you cannot conclude with certainty that the coin is not loaded.  However this does not mean that the converse is true.
In the example of the regression, the implicit null hypothesis is that h(x) is not a predictor for y.  You are going to reject this null hypothesis by looking at the confidence interval for the parameters
