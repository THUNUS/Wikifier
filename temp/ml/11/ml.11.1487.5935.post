On <ref name="slide" type="sci">page 12</ref>, I would have expected the $$cost(i)$$ function to be

$$
cost(i) = y^{(i)} log(h_\Theta( x^{(i)}) ) + (1 - y^{(i)} ) log(1 - h_\Theta( x^{(i)} ) )
$$

I.e the last part is $$ log(1 - h_\Theta( x^{(i)} ) ) $$ instead of $$ log( h_\Theta( x^{(i)} ) ) $$ as stated on the slide.
