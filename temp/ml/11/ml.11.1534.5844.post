Hey all,
I have a problem with viewing the video lectures on the web. When I start them I get the video popup with the white background and the close button on the right top, also the sound starts but I can't see anything expect for the white background... I now solved it with downloading the videos and what them with vlc. That okay for me, the only thing that doesn't work are the inline quizzes. I just wanted you to know that there might be an issue with the videos and maybe somebody knows a solutions.

regards 
Markus
