True, but in <ref name="lecture" type="sai">the lecture</ref> Prof Ng said he uses something like $$10^{-4}$$. You'd still get the problem of potentially different orders of magnitude, but there's no reason not to bracket around 1 instead of 0, symmetry is still broken and the orders of magnitude disappears. It would be interesting to look at convergence with randomisation around 1 instead of 0
