# MOOC Forum Wikifier

A chrome extension to wikify a MOOC discussion forum, for now on Coursera.org. The wikifier is a chrome extention that,
1. extracts mentions of lecture material entities such as "slide <number>", "lecture <number>", "week <number>" etc., or and different combinations of those and
2. hyperlinks them to actual lecture material, that is, a slide or a lecture video.
